A Model-based Approach to Identify Binding Sites in CLIP-Seq Data  

----------------  Description  -----------------------

Cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq) has made it possible to identify targeting sites of RNA-binding proteins in various cell culture systems and tissue types on a genome-wide scale. Here we present the MiClip R package,a novel model-based approach to identify high-confidence protein-RNA binding sites in CLIP-Seq datasets. This approach assigns confidence value to each binding site on a probabilistic basis. The MiClip package can be flexibly applied to analyze both HITS-CLIP/PAR-CLIP data in single-end/paired-end format.
